# EEG to surface mapping

This script builds a parcellation that allows to map EEG data to surface. ! Spatial resolution is highly limited ! This is only an approximation that allows for easy visualization and does not require MRI.
Uses a closest electrode approach to create parcels. Script originally written for LEMON data - 61 electrodes in 2010 space. Maps to fsaverage5.
